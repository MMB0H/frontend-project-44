# Welcome to my first project in Hexlet "Brain Games"!

In this project were implemented 5 math games based on javaScript.
Each game asks questions based on mathematics, and you need to think and answer correctly. You can win by answering correctly three times. Otherwise, start the game again.

These are the games:

1. Even number: whether the number is even or odd.
2. Calculator: Find result of the expression.
3. Gcd: Need to find the greatest common divisor.
4. Progression: Find missing number in the arithmetic progression.
5. Prime number: whether the number is prime or not.

   make install  
   make publish  
   npm link
